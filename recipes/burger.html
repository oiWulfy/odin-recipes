			<li>1 tbs Vegetable Oil</li>
			<li>Pinch Sea Salt & Ground Pepper</li>
			<h4>Batter</h4>
			<li>1 cup/120g Plain Flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
			<li>1 cup/125ml Water</li>
			<li>1 tbs Vegetable Oil</li>
			<h4>Coating</h4>
			<li>1 cup/50g Panko Bread Crumbs</li>
			<li>1 cup/120g Plain Flour</li>
			<li>1 tsp Ground Ginger</li>
			<li>1 tsp Sea Salt</li>
			<li>1 tbs Sesame Seeds</li>
			<li>1 tbs Gochugaru Chilli Flakes (or any mild dried chilli flakes)</li>
			<li>2 tsp Garlic Granules</li>
			<li>1 tbs Onion Granules</li>
			<li>1 cup/250ml Vegetable Oil for shallow frying</li>
			<h4>Sticky Apple & Soy Glaze</h4>

			<li>3/4 cup/180ml Light Soy Sauce</li>
			<li>3/4 cup/120g Brown Sugar</li>
			<li>3/4 cup/180ml Apple Juice</li>
			<li>5 cloves Garlic, minced</li>
			<li>1 tbs Fresh Ginger, minced</li>
			<li>3 Spring Onions, chopped fine</li>
			<li>1 tbs Sesame Oil</li>
			<li>1 cup/250ml Water</li>
			<li>2 tbs Cornflour mixed with 1/2 cup/125ml water</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Grab a large heavy based non stick frying pan & place it over a high
				heat, add the oil. When the pan is hot – add the mushrooms.
			</li>
			<li>
				Grab another frying pan or saucepan thats slightly smaller than the
				mushroom pan & place it directly on top of the mushrooms. It will
				flatten the mushrooms and make sure they are being seared completely.
				Leave the mushrooms for 4-5 minutes to cook, applying some pressure to
				the top pan, which will squeeze the water out of them, making them extra
				meaty.
			</li>
			<li>
				After 5 minutes, remove the top pan and season the mushrooms with sea
				salt and pepper. Flip the mushrooms over then place the pan back on top
				& cook + press for a further 4 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Once the mushrooms have cooked remove them from the pan and set them
				aside to slightly cool.
			</li>
			<li>
				Meanwhile add all the glaze ingredients (accept the cornflour) to a
				saucepan and place over a medium heat, bring the mix to a simmer. Allow
				to simmer for 5 minutes before whisking in the cornflour mixture.
			</li>
			<li>Next mix together the coating ingredients in a shallow bowl.</li>
			<li>
				Whisk together the batter ingredients in another bowl – adding enough
				water to make it a pancake batter style consistency.
			</li>
			<li>
				When the mushrooms are cool enough to handle, individually dip each
				mushroom first into the flour /panko mix then into the batter then back
				into the coating mixture, making sure they are coated all over evenly.
				Feel free to double dip them to get a thicker coating.
			</li>
			<li>
				To make them extra crispy, pre heat a large non stick frying pan over a
				medium heat with the frying oil. When the oil is hot (you can test by
				dropping in a bread crumb) add a couple of the coated mushrooms. Fry
				them on both sides for 3-4 minutes. When they’re golden & crisp, remove
				them from the oil & place them on to a plate lined with kitchen paper to
				soak up any excess oil.
			</li>
			<li>
				When your glaze is ready and your mushrooms are crispy, build your
				burgers. I fill mine with sriracha mayo, kimchi, fresh coriander, spring
				onions, lettuce, vegan cheese & a sprinkle of sesame seeds.
			</li>
