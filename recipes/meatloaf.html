			<li>1 cup/125g Panko Breadcrumbs</li>
			<li>
				1 cup/125g Walnuts, blitzed (if allergic use, use something like pumpkin

			</li>
			<li>1 can Chickpeas, water drained</li>
			<li>Zest of 1 Lemon</li>
			<h4>BBQ Glaze</h4>

			<li>1 cup/230g Tomato Ketchup</li>
			<li>3 tsp English Mustard</li>
			<li>4 tbs Balsamic Vinegar</li>
			<li>1 tsp Smoked Paprika</li>
			<li>1 tbs Soy Sauce</li>
			<li>3 tbs Coconut Sugar</li>
			<li>1 tbs Cumin</li>
			<li>1 tsp Garlic Powder</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp All spice</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Preheat your oven to 180 degrees C. Line a medium-sized baking dish/loaf
				tin with greaseproof paper.
			</li>
			<li>
				To a blender add the mushrooms and blitz until they are finely chopped.
			</li>
			<li>
				Place a large non-stick saucepan pan over a medium heat. Add the oil &
				when the pan is hot add the mushrooms. You want to saute them for around
				5 minutes so that you get rid of some of the water inside them & get
				them nicely golden.
			</li>
			<li>
				Next to the pan add the onion, garlic & red pepper plus the herbs,
				spices & seasoning. Sauté the mix for 5 minutes, stirring often. When
				you’ve got a nice colour on everything add the sweet potato. Saute the
				mix for a few more minutes before adding the breadcrumbs, walnuts,
				chickpeas, and lemon zest. Stir until all the ingredients are well
				combined. Turn the heat off, then using an old fashioned masher, lightly
				mash the mix breaking down any large chunks of sweet potato or
				chickpeas.
			</li>
			<li>
				Spoon the mixture into your lined loaf tin & compact it in as much as
				you can. Place the meatloaf on the bottom shelf of your oven & let it
				roast for 40 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Meanwhile make that lovely bbq glaze, add all the ingredients to a small
				saucepan & mix well, place the saucepan over a low heat & let the sauce
				bubble away for around 10 minutes. Stir every now and then. Once your
				glaze has thickened, turn off the heat and set it aside until the
				meatloaf is cooked.
			</li>
			<li>
				Once your meatloaf has been in the oven for 40 minutes take that baby
				out. Let the meatloaf stand for around 10 minutes before placing a flat
				baking tray on top then carefully whilst holding the tray with one hand
				& the loaf tin with the other, turn the tray upside down so that the
				meatloaf comes out. Lift off the loaf time & peel off any greaseproof
				paper that’s stuck.
			</li>
			<li>
				Pour lashings of bbq glaze over the meatloaf then place the tray into
				the oven for a further 10 minutes so the glaze caramelizes over the
				meatloaf.
			</li>
			<li>
				Serve your meatloaf straight away. Topped with cherry tomatoes & sautéed
				sage or serve it up in your meal prep containers. The meal prep with
				last up to 4 days in your fridge.
			</li>
